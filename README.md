# Call-Center-Dashboard
I developed a comprehensive "Call Center Dashboard" in Excel, creating modern dashboards and tables to analyze data. The project involved data preprocessing, cleaning, and visualization for insightful analytics.
## Dataset Used
- **Dataset:** [Call Center Dataset](https://github.com/Muhammad-Jan/Call-Center-Dashboard/blob/main/Call%20Center%20Dataset.xlsx)
## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
1.	Agent wise Calls and Satisfaction
2.	Top Agents Agents Performance
3.	Identify the Percentage of Recived Calls
4.	Average Satisfaction
5.	Calls Answer Wise "Yes"/"No"
6.	Total Calls
7.	Avg Talk Duration
8.	Avg Speed of Answer
9.	Day wise Calls Resolved
10.	Topic Wise Received Calls With Satisfaction
11.	Filtertion: Month And Resolved "Yes/no"
## Dashboard Interaction
- **Interactive Dashboard:** [Call-Center-Dashboard Project](https://github.com/Muhammad-Jan/Call-Center-Dashboard/blob/main/Call%20Center%20Dataset.xlsx)
  - The dashboard is equipped with **slicers** and **dynamic filters** to allow users to interact with the data and gain insights based on specific criteria.
## Process

### Data Preprocessing
- Conducted a thorough check of the dataset to identify and address missing values, anomalies, and inconsistencies.
- Ensured uniformity in data types, formats, and values to maintain data integrity.

### Data Cleaning
- Eliminated duplicate entries and corrected any errors present in the dataset.
- Standardized data entries to ensure accuracy and reliability in the analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Utilized **Pivot Tables** to aggregate and analyze data, focusing on key performance indicators (KPIs) such as call volume, agent performance, and satisfaction rates.
- Applied **Excel formulas** and **functions** to compute essential metrics, including average talk duration, speed of answer, and resolution rates.

### Data Visualization
- Developed **modern, interactive dashboards** using a variety of Excel charts, graphs, and tables to visually represent the data.
- Consolidated all Pivot Tables into a single, cohesive dashboard for a comprehensive overview.
- Integrated **slicers** to enhance interactivity, allowing users to filter and view data by specific criteria such as month, agent, or call topic.
